# 🌟 My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project is a showcase of my work, skills, and projects, built with React and styled with love. Dive in to see what I've been working on and get to know me better.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Below are the instructions to get started with the development and deployment process.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local development machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the App

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app. The page will automatically reload when you make changes.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will bundle React in production mode and optimize the build for the best performance. Your production-ready files will be in the `build` folder.

### Running Tests

To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode, run:

```bash
npm test
```
